Given your task, the most important libraries in Python you will likely use for modeling and simulation are NetworkX, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and possibly SimPy. For Natural Language Processing tasks, you might consider the NLTK library or Spacy.

To model your military maneuvers, here's an example of how you might break this down:

1. **Understand the basic building blocks of your problem.** In military operations, these are factors like forces, resources, location, terrain, objectives, etc. For each of these, you should have a corresponding object or data structure in your Python code. You could use a class for each soldier with attributes for their position, status, firepower, etc. Locations could be represented as nodes in a graph, with edges representing possible movements. Resources and objectives could also be nodes in this graph.

2. **Use NetworkX for modeling the relationships between these entities.** This library is used for creating, manipulating, and studying the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It includes several built-in functions for common graph theory problems and can be easily visualized using Matplotlib.

3. **Use NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.** NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing, and Pandas is built on top of it, offering convenient data structures for manipulating and analyzing data. These will be useful for analyzing the results of your simulations, such as identifying bottlenecks, finding optimal strategies, etc.

4. **Simulate military maneuvers with SimPy.** SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework. It allows you to model the flow of resources, and the timing and interaction of events. For instance, you could simulate a series of maneuvers by modeling each maneuver as a process that consumes resources and takes a certain amount of time.

5. **Use NLTK or Spacy for handling standard military terms and NATO alphabets.** These are Natural Language Processing libraries that allow you to tokenize, parse and analyze text. You can use them to transform your standard military terms and NATO alphabets into a format that can be used in your Python code.

6. **Plotting and visualizing your maneuvers can be done with Matplotlib.** This is a versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. For instance, you could visualize the graph of possible movements, the current locations of all forces, or the status of all objectives.

Here's a basic example of how some of this might work:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a directed graph for movement
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Nodes represent locations, with their positions as attributes
G.add_node('Alpha', pos=(0, 0))
G.add_node('Bravo', pos=(1, 0))
G.add_node('Charlie', pos=(0, 1))
G.add_node('Delta', pos=(1, 1))

# Edges represent possible movements, with the cost as an attribute
G.add_edge('Alpha', 'Bravo', cost=1)
G.add_edge('Alpha', 'Charlie', cost=1.5)
G.add_edge('Bravo', 'Delta', cost=2)
G.add_edge('Charlie', 'Delta', cost=1)

# Find the shortest path from Alpha to Delta
path = nx.shortest_path(G, 'Alpha', 'Delta', 'cost')
print('Shortest path:', path)

# Plot the graph with Matplotlib
pos = nx.get_node_attributes(G, 'pos')
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```

This example shows how you might represent the relationships between different locations using a graph, find the shortest path from one location to another,

 and visualize the graph. You would need to expand on this significantly to include all of the factors relevant to your specific problem, but it should give you a good starting point.
