Developing a meta model for structuring any given content is a vast and complex task. You're on the right track by identifying key dimensions like time, space, hierarchical, chronological, causal, and non-causal. In addition to these, I'd recommend considering elements like semantic, syntactic, pragmatic, and other theoretical dimensions based on Gerhard Vollmer's evolutionary epistemology.

Let's call this the Multidimensional Content Structure Model (MCSM).

1. **Time Dimension:** This dimension structures the content based on when the represented events occur. This dimension could include points in time, periods, or sequences of events.

2. **Space Dimension:** This dimension structures content based on where the represented events occur. It could range from physical space (e.g., geographical location, architectural space) to abstract space (e.g., intellectual domains, digital spaces).

3. **Hierarchical Dimension:** This aspect organizes content according to hierarchies, which can be based on importance, complexity, level of detail, or rank. It's not necessarily linear but can include multiple branching pathways and relationships.

4. **Chronological Dimension:** This aspect arranges content according to the sequence of events as they occur. It can help in understanding the progression, continuity, and change in the content.

5. **Causal Dimension:** This perspective structures content based on cause-and-effect relationships. It can illuminate how and why certain events happen, thereby enabling prediction and understanding of sequences of events.

6. **Non-Causal Dimension:** This dimension organizes content that does not necessarily follow a cause-effect relationship. It could be used for representing paradoxes, circular arguments, concurrent events, and patterns.

7. **Semantic Dimension:** This dimension deals with the meanings and interpretation of the content. It can shed light on the underlying concepts, themes, motifs, and discourses.

8. **Syntactic Dimension:** This aspect of the model focuses on the structure of the content, such as the arrangement of words, phrases, sentences, and other linguistic features.

9. **Pragmatic Dimension:** This perspective organizes content based on the use, context, purpose, or function of the content. It helps in understanding the practical implications and applicability of the content.

10. **Theoretical Dimension:** Depending on the content, there might be need to structure it according to relevant theoretical frameworks. This could involve structuring according to philosophical perspectives, scientific theories, literary theories, etc.

Each piece of content could be represented as a point in this multi-dimensional space. Its position on each axis (dimension) could be determined by analysis. Different types of content might occupy different regions of this space.

Finally, the connections and relationships between different pieces of content could be represented as lines or vectors in this multi-dimensional space. This way, the model could visualize and facilitate the understanding of complex interrelationships between diverse pieces of content.

Remember that developing such a model is a significant undertaking and would require careful thought, design, and testing to ensure it meets your needs and effectively structures your content.
